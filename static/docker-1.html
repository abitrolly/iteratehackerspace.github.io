          ## Introduction - What is Docker?

          We use Docker to provide "process isolation" for our applications/projects.

          process isolation is trying to keep your application and all its dependencies
          away from the actual issue of running your application.

          We want to make it easy to build our project, to have it be reproducible on
          every machine that has docker installed.

          ## Motiviating Example

          Think of `apt-get`. You have probably been used to doing

```bash
sudo apt-get install libfoobarbaz
```

<hr/>

But installing this is "destructive", because you are changing the filesystem and changing
the libraries available to the whole system. Sometimes this gives the familiar
"it works on my machine but not on yours" issues.

            ## Docker terms

1. Host. This is the system on which the docker binary is running
2. Dockerfile. This file describes all the steps that docker needs to do to build an image.
3. Image. This the result of the docker binary running the Dockerfile.
4. Container. A running instance of an image.
5. docker-compose. A program that we use with `yaml` files to make it easier to manage
   services built with docker.
6. build context. The directory and items not in .dockerignore in which the Dockerfile is located
   when the docker binary builds the image.

          ## Getting our project - Setup

Go ahead and go to our project repo:
[https://github.com/iteratehackerspace/iterate-summer-javascript-class-2018](https://github.com/iteratehackerspace/iterate-summer-javascript-class-2018)
					<hr/>

Fork the project to your account. Then clone (`git clone`)
the project and add our main repo as a new remote
to repo. I assume you already setup ssh keys with github.

```bash
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:iteratehackerspace/iterate-summer-javascript-class-2018.git
```

          ## Installing Docker
If you DO NOT have docker, then go to your newly cloned copy of the repo
and install it on your Ubuntu/Debian machine with:

```bash
sudo bash machine-setup/install-docker.sh
```

**NOTE** that this will restart your machine.
					<hr/>
On `OS X` just do:

```bash
$ brew cask install docker
```
        </textarea>
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
          ## Making the Docker Image
Double check that you docker installed:

```bash
$ command docker -v
```

Should print out a version at least `18`.
					<hr/>
Now in the repo, lets build the image:

```bash
$ docker build -t iterate/summer-class:latest .
```
        </textarea>
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
          ## While it is building, let's explain:

Sometimes you will see it this way as well:

```bash
docker build -t iterate/summer-class:latest - < Dockerfile
```

this is also acceptable but you don't get the build context.
The build context is where docker starts out from when it makes the image.

We passed the `Dockerfile` via shell redirection, aka `<`.

Just remember that you don't have access to the build context this way.

      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
          ## What was the command we did?
First let's see the built image:

```bash
$ docker images
```

You should see our image built there, it has the name `iterate/summer-class`.
Docker naming convention is like `[ORG]/[PROJECT]:[RELEASE-CUT]`
        </textarea>
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
          ## Running our image, aka making a container
We run our project with:

```
$ docker run --rm iterate/summer-class
```

And then try to open `localhost:3000` in our browser.

But you see that nothing comes up, why?

Because a running container is by default NOT exposed to the host via ports.
You have to explicitly port forward, this is very good for process isolation.

```
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 --rm iterate/summer-class
```

Now check in the browser.

      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
          ## Making changes and seeing results
Let's make some changes to our application, to `src/App.js` and on line 11,
change the words "Welcome to iterate" to something else, like "Welcome to _iterate_".

Make those changes, do you see the results in the web browser?

Well no, you won't. Why? Again process isolation, Docker is using its copy of the file instead
of the copy on the host machine, which is what you are editing. Just like we exposed the port
on the container, we can do the reverse for directories on the host.

          ## Stopping and restarting with volumes
Do:

```bash
$ docker ps
```

This will show you all the running containers, take the `CONTAINER ID` and copy paste it in:

```bash
$ docker kill <CONTAINER_ID>
```

        <textarea data-template>
          ## Couple of notes

          Due to the fact that there is no difference between a class and a function (at the first sight), it is a convention to write the first letter of a class name in uppercase.
          This makes the code more readable.

          What will be the difference in
          ```js
          //1
          const joeWithNew = new Person('Joe', 'programmer', 'black');

          //2
          const joeWithouthNew = Person('Joe', 'programmer', 'black');
          ```
        </textarea>
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
          ## Couple of notes

          joeWithNew will be an <span style="color:red">instance of Person</span>,
          whereas joeWithouthNew will be <span style="color:blue">undefined</span>.

          Why? Because Person is just a function and it returns undefined.

          ## Execution context

          As we know, it is possible to force a context on a JS function.

          ```js
          function foo(){
            console.log(this.bar);
          }

          const zoo = {
            bar: 'hey'
          };

          foo.call(zoo);
          foo.apply(zoo);
          ```
        </textarea>
      </section>

      <section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <textarea data-template>
            ## Execution context

            So there actually has to be a way to declare functions like sleep and run, then force the context of the object we want on it.

            ```js
            function Person(name, profession, colorOfHair){
              this.name = name;
              this.profession = profession;
              this.colorOfHair = colorOfHair;
            }

            function run(){
              console.log(`I am ${this.name}, and I am running.`);
            }

            function sleep(){
              console.log(`Shshsh, ${this.name} is sleeping.`);
            }

            const joe = new Person('Joe', 'programmer', 'black');
            const doe = new Person('Doe', 'biker', 'red');

            run.call(joe);
            run.call(doe);
            ```

      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
          ## Why?

          Yes, it is possible. But why would we actually do that?

          The reason is memory management.
        </textarea>
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
          ### Why?

          In the first example where the methods were being assigned to <span style="color:red">this</span> (the object itself), the size of the object was approximately <span style="color:orange">102B</span>.

          On the other hand, when the functions were independant the size of the object was approximately <span style="color:orange">86B</span>.
        </textarea>
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
          ## Why?

          Now imagine that there are 100 instances of Person class. <span style="color:orange">1600B</span> of redundant memory is being used. We had the same result by forcing a context on a function.
        </textarea>
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
          ## Solution

          There has to be a way to solve this problem. We need a function that every time will be called by an automatically forced context.
        </textarea>
      </section>

      <section data-markdown>
        <textarea data-template>
          #### The solution is the __prototype__.

          ```js
          function Person(name, profession, colorOfHair){
            this.name = name;
            this.profession = profession;
            this.colorOfHair = colorOfHair;
          }

          Person.prototype.run = function(){
            console.log(`I am ${this.name}, and I am running.`);
          }

          Person.prototype.sleep = function(){
            console.log(`Shshsh, ${this.name} is sleeping.`);
          }

          const joe = new Person('Joe', 'programmer', 'black');
          const doe = new Person('Doe', 'biker', 'red');

          joe.run();
          doe.run();
          ```

          ## Static methods

          Sometimes we do not want to add methods to the prototype of the class, and not pass it to any instance of the class.
          In other words, we do not want that method to be accessible on the prototype chain.
          Very often those methods are just utility (helper) functions for an application.

          ## Static methods

          For example, all the methods in the Math class (or object, because everything in JS are objects)
          are <span style="color: red">static</span>.
          And they are used as utility functions in our JS apps.
          ```js
          Math.floor();
          Math.ceil();
          Math.random();

          Although very often you can do things with regular methods,
          <span style="color:orange">setters</span> and <span style="color:orange">getters</span> exist in JS.
          We can say, that they are dynamic properties.

          ## Subclassing or inheritance

          Now, imagine we want a class Animal, and we want a class Dog.
          Right now, the way we would do it is creating seperate classes for each,
          and if they share some common things, add to both class prototypes.

      <section data-markdown>

          ## Subclassing or inheritance

          But again, as in real life, dog is an animal, and there are many things that are shared between them,
          for example methods like running, eating, etc...

          For this reason, we can make an Animal class, then make a dog class which will be a
          <span style="color:red">subclass</span> of Animal,
          then inherit the shared methods automatically.

          But I also want my dog to be able to bark, because dogs usually bark. :D

          ### Subclassing or inheritance

          As we discussed earlier, it is not convenient to add a function directly to the object.
          So I have to make a Dog class, which will take methods from Animal class, and add a bark method.

            #### Subclassing or inheritance

            ```js
            class Dog extends Animal {
              bark(){
                let times = Math.floor(Math.random()*20);
                while (times >= 0){
                  console.log('haf');
                  times--;
                }
              }
            }

            const dog = new Dog;
            dog.bark();
            dog.run();
            console.log(dog); //Dog {name: undefined, color: undefined, age: undefined, type: undefined}
            ```

            #### Subclassing

            Let's add a constructor to Dog, because we do not want all it's properties to be undefined.

            ```js
            constructor(name, color, age){
              this.name = name;
              this.color = color;
              this.age = age;
            }
            ```

          <textarea data-template>
            #### Subclassing

            If now, we try creating a new instance of dog

            ```js
            const dog = new Dog('rex', 'black', 12);
            ```

            We get an <span style="color:red">error</span>. Why? Because we want to construct the Dog class, based on Animal class.
            But the Animal class is not constructed yet. Means, it does not have it's properties.

            #### Super

            We have to construct the Animal class in the first place. And how do we construct any class?
            By calling its contructor. The keyword to call the constructor of the class a class inherited from is <span style="color:orange">super()</span>

        <section data-markdown>
          <textarea data-template>
            #### Super

            We call the constructor with super(), and we pass the arguments.

            ```js
            constructor(name, color, age){
              super(name, color, age, 'dog');
            }
            ```

            Note, the constructor of Dog is not getting a type argument, because the type is dog, so there
            is no need to make it an argument. The name, color, age can be different between 2 dogs, but not the type.

            #### Dog class

            ```js
            class Dog extends Animal {
              constructor(name, color, age){
                super(name, color, age, 'dog');
              }
              bark(){
                let times = Math.floor(Math.random()*20);
                while (times >= 0){
                  console.log('haf');
                  times--;
                }
              }
            }

            const dog = new Dog('rex', 'black', 12);
            console.log(dog);
            dog.run();
            dog.eat();
            dog.bark();
            ```

            #### Subclassing

            If a class does not have a constructor, and is being initiated with some arguments,
            the arguments are going to automatically be passed to the parents constructor.
            Which means, if I do not make a constructor for the dog class, and make a new object like
            ```js
            const dog = new Dog('rex', 'black', 12, 'dog');
            ```

            This would still work, and my dog object would have the properties with their values.

            #### Subclassing

            Now, a question can be if the constructor of the parent class is being called automatically,
            why do we need the keyword super.

            Let's imagine, that we wanted to add some properties to the Dog class. For example, some dogs have cut tails.
            We only add properties to a class in a constructor, so we already need a constructor for dog.

            But, if we make a constructor, without calling the parents constructor an exception is being thrown. So the contructor would look like this

            }
